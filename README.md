On this project I made a calculator with JS, html and css, to continue practicing the basic concepts of programing with them.

The calculator contains a display where the user can see the previous input at the top of it, and the number currently being typed at the bottom. With the available buttons very basic math operations can be performed, with integer or floating-point numbers. 

Keyboard support was added as the last step of the project.
